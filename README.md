##PID Tuning

In order to get the PID Control relatively tuned I started by manually setting the PID constants so that it could at least go through a single round.

1. I started by tuning the P constant. I tried keeping the value small enough that the car would not be oscillate too much, I tried values in range from (1-0.01), for a throttle of 0.3 I started with 0.5
2. I then moved on to tuning the D constant. I tried making the D value small enough to make the car oscillate a little less than usual an keep it going to be constant I tried from (3-0.5), for a throttle of 0.3, 1.3 seemed to work relatively fine.
3. I then moved to the I constant. Because the P and D values kept on oscillating due to systematic error I had to give a very small integral error, because it is the integration of squared error, the I constant had to be very small. I tried from (0.0005-0.00001), for a throttle of 0.3, 0.0003 seemed to work well

After manually tuning the PID loop I implemented a twiddle algorithm on the constants, the twiddle algorithm would be repeating and based on the total average error of the system. However, due to fact that sometimes the constants would cause the system to fail and run off track I needed to implement some fail safes:
1. After a certain buffer steps:
   * If the CTE was > 6, then the car was assumed off track
   * If the car had a speed less than 1, then it was assumed stuck
2. If the car had triggered one of these fail safes and the car did not travel half of the reset distance the constants were deemed unusable and thus the error was set to be very large  
3. The average error was used to tune the constants.
4. I thus ran the twiddle algorithm on these initally tuned values and after many iterations this is what I got:
   * For throttle 0.3:
     * `kP: 0.273843, kI: 0.000953428, kD: 2.01178` 
   * For throttle 0.5:
     * `kP: 0.27, kI: 0.00100126, kD: 2.91178`

* Simulator. You can download these from the [project intro page](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim/releases) in the classroom.

Fellow students have put together a guide to Windows set-up for the project [here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-selfdrivingcar/files/Kidnapped_Vehicle_Windows_Setup.pdf) if the environment you have set up for the Sensor Fusion projects does not work for this project. There's also an experimental patch for windows in this [PR](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-PID-Control-Project/pull/3).

## Basic Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./pid`. 

Tips for setting up your environment can be found [here](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/40f38239-66b6-46ec-ae68-03afd8a601c8/modules/0949fca6-b379-42af-a919-ee50aa304e6a/lessons/f758c44c-5e40-4e01-93b5-1a82aa4e044f/concepts/23d376c7-0195-4276-bdf0-e02f1f3c665d)

## Editor Settings

We've purposefully kept editor configuration files out of this repo in order to
keep it as simple and environment agnostic as possible. However, we recommend
using the following settings:

* indent using spaces
* set tab width to 2 spaces (keeps the matrices in source code aligned)

## Code Style

Please (do your best to) stick to [Google's C++ style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).

## Project Instructions and Rubric

Note: regardless of the changes you make, your project must be buildable using
cmake and make!

More information is only accessible by people who are already enrolled in Term 2
of CarND. If you are enrolled, see [the project page](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/40f38239-66b6-46ec-ae68-03afd8a601c8/modules/f1820894-8322-4bb3-81aa-b26b3c6dcbaf/lessons/e8235395-22dd-4b87-88e0-d108c5e5bbf4/concepts/6a4d8d42-6a04-4aa6-b284-1697c0fd6562)
for instructions and the project rubric.

## Hints!

* You don't have to follow this directory structure, but if you do, your work
  will span all of the .cpp files here. Keep an eye out for TODOs.

## Call for IDE Profiles Pull Requests

Help your fellow students!

We decided to create Makefiles with cmake to keep this project as platform
agnostic as possible. Similarly, we omitted IDE profiles in order to we ensure
that students don't feel pressured to use one IDE or another.

However! I'd love to help people get up and running with their IDEs of choice.
If you've created a profile for an IDE that you think other students would
appreciate, we'd love to have you add the requisite profile files and
instructions to ide_profiles/. For example if you wanted to add a VS Code
profile, you'd add:

* /ide_profiles/vscode/.vscode
* /ide_profiles/vscode/README.md

The README should explain what the profile does, how to take advantage of it,
and how to install it.

Frankly, I've never been involved in a project with multiple IDE profiles
before. I believe the best way to handle this would be to keep them out of the
repo root to avoid clutter. My expectation is that most profiles will include
instructions to copy files to a new location to get picked up by the IDE, but
that's just a guess.

One last note here: regardless of the IDE used, every submitted project must
still be compilable with cmake and make./
